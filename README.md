## ✨ What is openCreate?

**openCreate** is my all-in-one, freedom-first creative suite that bundles the best open-source tools into one easy-to-install package. Whether you’re editing photos, designing vectors, animating in 3D, cutting videos, or slicing clips, openCreate has you covered — without the bloat, the bugginess, or the subscription guilt.

> Creativity shouldn't come with a monthly invoice.

So was I.

I built openCreate because I believe creative power should belong to everyone — not to companies charging you rent for your own imagination.
